# Auto Design System

The Auto Design System is a collection of reusable UI components built with React, styled with Tailwind CSS, and leveraging design tokens from the `@autonomys/design-tokens` package.

## Getting Started

To use the design system in your project, install the package:

```bash
yarn add @autonomys/design-system
```

Then import the components and styles in your application:

```jsx
// Import components
import { Button, Dropdown } from '@autonomys/design-system'

// Import styles
import '@autonomys/design-system/dist/styles.css'
```

## Design Principles

- **Consistency**: All components follow the same design language
- **Accessibility**: Built with a11y best practices in mind
- **Flexibility**: Components can be customized through props
- **Simplicity**: Easy to use and understand

## Design Tokens

This design system uses design tokens from `@autonomys/design-tokens` for colors, typography, spacing, and more. These tokens are used to style components through Tailwind CSS classes.

## Available Components

- **Button**: A versatile button component with various styles and states
- **Dropdown**: A dropdown select component with customizable options

More components will be added in future releases.
